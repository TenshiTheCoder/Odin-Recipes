  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>9 lasagna noodles (uncooked or cooked, depending on the type)</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
    <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 jar (about 24 ounces) marinara sauce or spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>1 egg (optional, for mixing with ricotta)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>

    <li>
      <p>Preparing the meat: </p>
      1: In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage until browned. Drain any excess fat.
      2: Add the marinara sauce to the meat and stir to combine. Let it simmer for a few minutes.
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Prepping the Ricotta mixture:</p>
        1: In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg (if using), dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Layering the Lasagna:</p>
        1: In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.
        2: Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.
        3: Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.
        4: Sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese.
        5: Add another layer of meat sauce over the cheese.
        6: Repeat the layers: noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella cheese, and meat sauce.
        7: For the final layer, place the last 3 noodles on top, cover with the remaining meat sauce, 
            and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Baking the Lasagna:</p>
        1: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can spray the foil with cooking spray).
        2: Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
        3: Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Let the Lasagna rest:</p>
        1: Once done, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set.
    </li>

    <p>
      Cut into your preferred sizes and serve hot. Enjoy!
