    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>

    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1/4 cup olives, chopped (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup raisins (optional)</li>

    <p>For the plantain layer:</p>
    <li>3-4 ripe plantains (yellow with black spots)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cheese (such as mozzarella or cheddar), shredded (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk (optional, for creaminess)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Oil for frying (if frying the plantains)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class = "pinon-steps">
      <p>Prepare the Plantains;</p>
      
        <li>Peel the ripe plantains and cut them into 1-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the plantain pieces. Cook for about 10-15 minutes until they are tender.</li>
        <li>Drain the plantains and mash them in a bowl. You can add a little milk and salt for creaminess if desired.</li>

      <p>Make the meat filling:</p>

        <li>In a large skillet, heat a little oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and minced garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are soft.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef (or pork) to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, Adobo seasoning, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper. </li>
        <li>If using, add the chopped olives and raisins. Simmer for about 5-10 minutes until the flavors meld.</li>

      <p>Assemble the Pinon:</p>

        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>In a greased baking dish, spread half of the mashed plantains evenly on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Layer the meat filling over the plantains.</li>
        <li>Top the meat with the remaining mashed plantains, spreading it evenly. If desired, sprinkle shredded cheese on top.</li>

      <p>Baking:</p>

      <li>
        Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden and slightly crispy.
      </li>

      <p>Serving:</p>

      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Cut into squares and serve warm. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley if desired.
      </li>

    </ol>
