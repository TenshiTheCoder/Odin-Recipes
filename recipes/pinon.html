  <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>Prepare the Plantains;</p>
      
      <li>
        1: Peel the ripe plantains and cut them into 1-inch pieces.
        2: In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the plantain pieces. Cook for about 10-15 minutes until they are tender.
        3: Drain the plantains and mash them in a bowl. You can add a little milk and salt for creaminess if desired.
      </li>

      <p>Make the meat filling:</p>

      <li>
        1: In a large skillet, heat a little oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and minced garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are soft.
        2: Add the ground beef (or pork) to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon.
        3: Stir in the tomato sauce, adobo seasoning, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper. 
            If using, add the chopped olives and raisins. Simmer for about 5-10 minutes until the flavors meld.
      </li>

      <p>Assemble the Pinon:</p>

      <li>
        1: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
        2: In a greased baking dish, spread half of the mashed plantains evenly on the bottom.
        3: Layer the meat filling over the plantains.
        4: Top the meat with the remaining mashed plantains, spreading it evenly. If desired, sprinkle shredded cheese on top.
      </li>

      <p>Baking:</p>

      <li>
        Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden and slightly crispy.
      </li>

      <p>Serving:</p>

      <li>
        1: Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Cut into squares and serve warm. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley if desired.
